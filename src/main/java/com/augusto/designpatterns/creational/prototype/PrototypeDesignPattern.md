## What is the Prototype Design Pattern?

The Prototype Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that allows you to create new objects by copying an existing object, called a prototype, and modifying its state to create a new object.

## Why use the Prototype Design Pattern?

The Prototype Design Pattern is useful when you want to create new objects with a similar structure to existing objects, but with different values for some of the fields.

## How to use the Prototype Design Pattern?

1. Create a class that implements the Cloneable interface.
2. Override the clone() method to create a new object with the same structure as the original object, but with different values for some of the fields.
3. Call the clone() method to create a new object with the same structure as the original object, but with different values for some of the fields.
